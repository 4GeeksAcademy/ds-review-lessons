# Data Science Curriculum Notebooks

Welcome to the Data Science Curriculum Notebooks repository! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks covering various topics in the field of data science. These notebooks are designed to supplement your learning and provide hands-on practice with real-world datasets and examples.

## Notebooks

You can find the following notebooks in this repository:
- [Notebook 0: Descriptive Statistics](00-descriptive-statistics.ipynb)
- [Notebook 1: Simple Linear Regression](01-simple-linear-regression.ipynb)
- [Notebook 2: Multiple Linear Regression](02-multiple-linear-regression.ipynb)
- [Notebook 3: Regularized Linear Regression](03-regularized-linear-regression.ipynb)
- [Notebook 4: Logistic Regression](04-logistic-regression.ipynb)

Feel free to explore and review these notebooks at your own pace.

## Opening Notebooks in CodeSpace

Due to the interactive elements in these notebooks, I recommend opening them in Codespace. CodeSpace provides an interactive environment where you can run and modify code in the cloud. Simply fork this repo and create a codespace on master.

## Installing Required Modules

Before running the notebooks, make sure to install all the required Python modules. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
